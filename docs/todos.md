# Graphics
- [ ] Simple shadows
- [ ] Refactor recompilation (should have Trait that register path and recompile shaders)
- [ ] Show lights
- [ ] Post processing: Sun + flare, Bloom, ambient occlusion
- [ ] If too light (3 render passes...), move shadow map gen to second renderpass (same as gbuffer) and do lighting in third 

# Animation
Figure it out

# Art
- [ ] More outside props asset (trees, rocks, ...)
- [ ] Figure out inside and buildings

# Network
- [ ] Replace json by cbor
- [ ] Send reliable (for chat messages)

# Editor
- [ ] Prompt before exit
- [ ] Gizmos: show transform + Axis
- [ ] Easier load and save
- [ ] Quick switch between existing levels
- [ ] Create template from entity in editor

# BUGS:
- [ ] GUI does not resize (imgui renderer problem)
- [ ] When window out of focuse sometime the input is stuck in one direction (network)
